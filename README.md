### Description

The encryption methods used in this program are probably some of the best available for Visual Basic. There are about 7 different methods of encryption featured in this program. For example, Skipjack, CryptAPI, Blowfish, and more. I adapted the main design of the program from another program. So you may see similarities in code and looks. But hey, thats what PSC is. Just a way to share code and adapt that code for your own personal use. I threw on a login feature to make it more secure so people cant go around encrypting and decrypting stuff on your PC. It's a simple, yet smart login feature than anyone could use in their programs. Please vote, leave comments, and enjoy the code! If you like this, please email me and tell me and I might make more versions of it. Thanks!!
 
### More Info
 
Don't encrypt stuff required by Windows :). You never know what'll happen.
